1. Introduction

Intel® DSA is a high-performance data copy and transformation accelerator that will be
integrated into future Intel® processors, targeted for optimizing streaming data movement
and transformation operations common with applications for high-performance storage,
networking, persistent memory, and various data processing applications.

Intel® DSA replaces the Intel® QuickData Technology, which is a part of Intel® I/O 
Acceleration Technology.

The goal is to provide higher overall system performance for data mover and transformation
operations while freeing up CPU cycles for higher-level functions. Intel® DSA enables
high-performance data mover capability to/from volatile memory, persistent memory,
memory-mapped I/O, and through a Non-Transparent Bridge (NTB) device to/from remote volatile
and persistent memory on another node in a cluster. Enumeration and configuration are done
with a PCI Express* compatible programming interface to the Operating System (OS) and can be
controlled through a device driver.

Besides the basic data mover operations, Intel® DSA supports a set of transformation
operations on memory. For example:

Generate and test CRC checksum, or Data Integrity Field (DIF) to support storage and
networking applications.
Memory Compare and delta generate/merge to support VM migration, VM Fast check-pointing, and
software-managed memory deduplication usages.

We did a performance comparison test, and the QPS calculated by CRC were 960124 and 7977434
respectively in the case of 4K size without and with DSA. About a nine-times improvement
using DSA in performance.

2. Check DSA hardware
  $ lspci -nn | grep 8086:0b25
 
 If get any information, which mean the system have DSA hardware

3. build libaccel-config
3.1 install dependency package
  For ubuntu:
    $ sudo apt install -y uuid-dev libjson-c-dev libkmod-dev libsystemd-dev autoconf automake libtool
  For centos
    $ yum install -y libuuid-devel json-c-devel kmod-devel systemd-devel autoconf automake libtool
   
3.2 build share library
    $ git clone https://github.com/intel/idxd-config && cd idxd-config && git checkout stable
    $ cd idxd-config
    $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --disable-docs --disable-logging
    $ make -j
    $ cp -P ./accfg/lib/.libs/libaccel-config.so ${LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH}
    $ cp -P ./accfg/lib/.libs/libaccel-config.so.1 ${LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH}
    $ cp ./accfg/lib/.libs/libaccel-config.so.1.0.0 ${LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH}

4. Unit test for DSA Calculate CRC
  $ cmake -D BUILD_TESTING=1 ..
  $ make -j
  $./output/zfile_test
